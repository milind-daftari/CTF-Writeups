This challenge is about recon. First, we have to find a social media account for the user "mickey_z_scott".

I searched for mickey_z_scott on https://www.idcrawl.com/u/mickey_z_scott . There I found an X (Twitter account) and the flag was in the bio. I also found a username "scottyisthebest".

FLAG for Bad Actor: Amazon{0S1NT_1s_c00l}

Now, let's search "scottyisthebest" on github. We see a profile with a few commits.
